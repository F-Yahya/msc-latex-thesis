\chapter*{ABSTRACT}
This is a statement that describes in a concise way the whole of your project work. It should be
one of the last things that you should produce in relation to your project as it should encapsulate
what is actually in the project.

The abstract should not be more that 200 words long and it must not contain any references;
moreover, it should be written in such a way that it should provide a reader with sufficient
information about the work that follows in order to enable him/her decide on whether the
chapters that follow are worth reading. Thus, it should clearly state the topic of the project, the
approach taken, the main findings and conclusions.
